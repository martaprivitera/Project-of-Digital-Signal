This repository contains the following documents:

For the Image Classification task we developed four different Colab notebooks, each one for a different pre-trained Model:

- Classification_MobileNet.ipynb

- Classification_ResNet.ipynb

- Classification_VGG.ipynb

- Classification_FE.ipynb

For the Image Retrieval task we developed a single Colab document:

- Image_Retrieval_MobileNet.ipynb

For the Audio Classification task we create the Colab document with the implementation of the neural network:

- DSIM Audio Classification.ipynb

For the DEMO we create a single file:

- DEMO.ipynb containing the three different demo for each task.
  
Interactive Snippets referred to specific task should be executed immediately after the corresponding preparation functions to avoid conflicts between different demos during execution.
